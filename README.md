Some apparmor profiles. I'm putting them on github just in case anyone
else finds them useful. It's frequently not easy to find apparmor profiles
to use as a starting point, and creating them from scratch is -ahem-
"time consuming".

One may reasonably quibble about whether I was too strict or too lenient
on these profiles. Mostly, I was trying to learn how to use apparmor and
wanted to try and make my browsers not run "unconfined".

Enjoy!
